Every story has a begining, somewhere to start, or at least, a starting point. This is where this story begins, the seed, the source. It might not be where you started your journey, for you, dear reader, this may be far from your starting point, and this is not the begining of the story, but it is where it grew from, this place is the source.

And what exactly is this place? It is a busy metropolitan railway station, a place where journeys begin and end, only they don't, like this story, the journeys are only passing through. In any case, passing through the railway station, jostling with the throng of tired travelers, is a man, Mr. Smith perhaps, a nice anonymous name for an apparently unremarkable man, but then it is possible he remains unremarkable, because, like the rest of us, he has made some effort to fit in, to not seem different or stand out, to be as it were, unremarkable.

Alighting from the slightly delayed ten seventeen from London Victoria, Mr. Smith, John to his friends, heaves his suitcase onto the platform, its little plastic wheels clicking on the oil black ground. He draws a hand through his untidy hair, neither improving nor disturbing the overall look, besides it is more of a gesture of despair at the state of the trains, the noise and clamour of his fellow travelers, the screaching of the tannoy and the unintelligible garble which is the announcement, the message can't be that important or they would fix it wouldn't they?
