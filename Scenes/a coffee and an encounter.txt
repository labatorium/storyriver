Carla the stripper stood in the coffee stand que. No one here knew she was a stripper. Sure one of the patrons of the establishment where she worked, might pass by, but they never recognised her out of her work outfit, which she supposed meant, they didn't recognise her with her clothes on and her wig off. The que grew one place shorter and everyone shuffled forward a little.

Her high heels scuffed at floor as she moved up, An anxious glance at the large round clock which hung above the ticket manchines, she had plenty of time, ten minuites, but these moments are always tense, will the person in front be one off those who doesn't seem to have a train to catch, a dawdler with time to kill and a perchance for carrying small change, and using it? The que clicked down another place, the clock clicked down another minute.

A pigeon flapped over the consession stand as a fat child chased it out from under a bench. With waving arms and shrill cries of exitement the toddler ran round and round in a circle till it fell over and began an ominous silence. A mother scooped the child up and dumped it unceremouniously in a push chair and admonished, little Darleen, before the tears could begin.

"Can I get you something?" a young man about her age was looking at Carla. She had reached the front of the que.

"Hey, you are Carla arn't you?" the young man asked suddenly. "I guess you don't remember me, we were at art collage together. I'm Shaun, painting and sculpture? You were doing acting and dance I think."

She didn't remember him. She had had her admirers at Collage, some she'd dallied with, others, had admired from afar.

"Look you are probably rushing for a train, let me get you your coffee? is it? You know where I am, come round for a chat sometime."
