=====================

Experimental repository

Prospective build of a GIT repository for use as a collaborative creative writing tool. Investigating GIT's potential (or lack) for use as such a tool.

First design:
character and scene text - overview / list of current characters and scenes.
character and scene notes folders - contain detailed thumbnail sketches of characters and scenes respectively.

Pieces folder contains scenes with characters in them, the actual piece of creative writing which forms a piece of the story.


Technical aspects:

Each piece needs tagging with the scene and the characters in it, so when compiled (using say a wiki) the readers can follow a character or read the action in a scene.


Roles:

Writers
Editors
Collaborative editors (Editors who's edits are not checked by the writer)
Proof readers


The Rules:
Or the polite way, so everyone can play nicely together.

The creator of a character or scene is the owner of the character or scene. It is up to them to keep the character and scene logs up to date. Only they can give permission for a character to be killed off or maimed, or a scene to be destroyed or damaged.

Anyone can write using an existing character or scene (ie: a character or scene created by someone else), indeed this is essential to the rule interconnectedness.

The rule of interconnectedness states that a new character can only be introduced in an existing scene, and a new scene can only be created with an existing character or characters. This ensures there is always a trail of characters and scenes to follow.

Characters and scenes should be as consistent as possible.
