Storyriver
=====================

Experimental creative writing repository

Have a look at an existing scene.txt (in the scenes folder)) it contains a bit of creative writing and a series of tags. You check out the story so far and join in the fun at smartians.co.uk where a web interface is also provided to contribute through. (No registration needed to read the story) or you can contribute to the storyriver by forking this repository then requesting a pull from the labatorium.


Technical aspects:

All scene files currently live in the Scenes/ folder.

The title of the scene is the file name without the extension.

The file has to be a .txt file at the moment.

The tags which are recognised are:-

[aut:author name]
[chr:character name]
[chr:prop name]
[set:place or location name]
[edt:editor name]
[pre:a scene which precedes this scene]

You can have multiples of every tag. You need either an existing author, character or set refrenced in the file for anyone to have a chance to find your work.


Roles:

Writers
Editors
Collaborative editors (Editors who's edits are not checked by the writer)
Proof readers


The Rules:
Or the polite way, so everyone can play nicely together.

The creator of a character or scene is the owner of the character or scene. It is up to them to keep the character and scene logs up to date. Only they can give permission for a character to be killed off or maimed, or a scene to be destroyed or damaged.

Anyone can write using an existing character or scene (ie: a character or scene created by someone else), indeed this is essential to the rule interconnectedness.

The rule of interconnectedness states that a new character can only be introduced in an existing scene, and a new scene can only be created with an existing character or characters. This ensures there is always a trail of characters and scenes to follow.

Characters and scenes should be as consistent as possible.
